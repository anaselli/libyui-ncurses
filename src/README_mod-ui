YWidget generates a core if the widget is created on stack
----------------------------------------------------------


TO DO - Common issues:
----------------------
- Use WidgetFactory create methods, e.g. in NCAskForDirectory/File, NCPkgPopups
- call YUI_CHECK_NEW(() for all with 'new' created widgets, e.g. NCPopuptextEntry


NCTree
------
YItemIterator itemsBegin()/itemsEnd() 			used to iterate over toplevel items
YItemIterator YTreeItem::childrenBegin()/childrenEnd()  used to iterate over children


EVENTs
------
TODO: 	remove YCPValue result; from NCursesEvent (check where 'result' is used,
      	maybe a string value can be used)


SelectionBox
------------
selectItem() added  
addItem (string, bool ) added 	
TODO: 	test NCPkgPopupDeps which uses addItem(string, bool) 


NCComboBox
----------
Don't create widget NCPopupList on the stack!!!
This leads to segfault when widgets are deleted from YUI at the end!
call YDialog::deleteTopmostDialog(); to delete NCPopupList


NCPopupMenu/NCMenuButton
-------------------------
Don't create NCPopupMenu on the stack - reason see above
store menu selection as YMenuItem in NCursesEvent and create 
an YMenuEvent(YmenuItem) (in  NCtoY2Event )

YNCursesUI.cc
-------------
Don't create NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForExistingFile/NCAskForExistingDirectory
on the stack


NCFrame
-------
whether a frame is strechable or not depends on the children, if a children is
stretchable, the frame also is stretchable
-> NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForFile: setStretchable for NCComboBox true


NCInputField
------------
property 'mayedit' removed, is not supported for InputField - was never 
supported before (for TextEntry) 
param 'initialText' removed
TODO: 	what's the difference between InputMaxLength and maxInputLength ???


NCIntField
----------
Don't create NCPopupTextEntry on the stack !!!


NCPopupTextEntry
----------------
YCPValues removed


NCDialog
--------
don't call 'delete' for helpPopup use deleteTopmostDialog() instead !
TODO:  	check code concerning helpPopup 
        Problem: start example Events.ycp,
                 press F1,
                 timeout event obviously applies to help popup and
                 therefore the richtext widget for shwoing the events
                 cannot be found
           
NCPopupInfo
-----------
doesn't work corretcly if called from NCDialog


NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForFile
------------------------------
- ComboBox entries are added twice
- Don't use widget IDs; compare widget pointers instead


NCMultiLineEdit
---------------
param 'initialText' removed


NCPushButton
------------
don't call isDefaultButton() in constructor but in setSize()
setFunctionHotKey() works


NCTable/NCPkgTable
------------------
TODO: initialize header in constructor, set each header item separately 
      setHeader(): call YTable::setTableHeader ???
      NCPopupMenu


NCMenuButton/NCPopupMenu
------------------------
- what about default button? HuHa: MenuButton cannot be teh default button ->
  code removed
- only dummy rebuildMenuTree() added (should be ok)

TODO: test replace widget      

NCRichText
----------
TODO: hyper links don't yet work


PackageSelector
--------------
after terminating the package selector:

[ui] YUI_core.cc(~YUI):83 2 open dialogs left over
