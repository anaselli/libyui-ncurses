NCMuliSelectionBox
NCIntField
NCInputField
NCPushBUtton
NCAlignment
NCMultiLineEdit
NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForFile
NCTable
NCRichText


almost DONE - all UI examples work (correctly or only with minor problems)/
-----------   some further checks/tests required

NCMenuButton
- all examples work correctly - but ChangeWidget has to be tested
  (rebuildTree is a NOP so far)

NCComboBox/NCSelectionBox
- all examples work - but check whether the index is set correctly in any case


TESTED - all UI examples tested/unsolved problems existing
------
EVENTs (class NCursesEvent, example Events.ycp)
- example works correctly except of problem with NCPopupInfo on F1 
  (strange things happen: 1. when a timout event is sent,
                          2. if F1 or ESC is pressed again )



MORE tests required
-------------------
ENCODING correct (UTF-8 encoding/NCstring) ??? - both for input(e.g. NCInputField) 
and text output, setLanguage() moved
test ChangeWidget for every widget


NOT yet PORTED:
---------------
NCDialog: 	not ported at all because YDialog isn't ported yet

PackageSelector:
- layout is created with the widget factory or creating the NCWidgets

FIXME:
- fix NCPkgPopupDeps::showSolutions()

TODO:
- create YOU layout

TESTED:
- Filter menu works
- Actions menu works
- Information menu works
- Etc menu works except of replacing the menu item autocheck on/off and FileHandler
- handle hyperlinks ("pkg:") -> see handleEvent( ) 
- "Solving ..." popup in NCPkgPopupDeps() is shown correctly
