DONE - all UI examples work correctly/no known problems
----
NCTree
NCMuliSelectionBox
NCIntField
NCInputField
NCPushBUtton
NCAlignment
NCMultiLineEdit
NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForFile
NCTable


almost DONE - all UI examples work (correctly or only with minor problems)/
-----------   some further checks/tests required

NCRichText
- hyperlink doesn't work

NCMenuButton
- all examples work correctly - but ChangeWidget has to be tested
  (rebuildTree is a NOP so far)

NCComboBox/NCSelectionBox
- all examples work - but check whether the index is set correctly in any case


TESTED - all UI examples tested/unsolved problems existing
------
EVENTs (class NCursesEvent, example Events.ycp)
- example works correctly except of problem with NCPopupInfo on F1 
  (y2base terminates if popup is open and a timout event is sent)



MORE tests required
-------------------
ENCODING correct (UTF-8 encoding/NCstring) ??? - both for input(e.g. NCInputField) 
and text output;
test ChangeWidget for every widget


NOT yet PORTED:
---------------
NCDialog: 	not ported at all because YDialog isn't ported yet

PackageSelector:
At the moment works with existing code, i.e. still reads the ycp layout
file and therefore uses YCP widget ids internally to get the menu selection
and button ids. 

FIXME:
- NCPkgPopupTree::cloneTree() doesn't build the tree correctly
- fix NCPkgPopupDeps::showSolutions()

TODO:
- create layout with widget factory and get rid of the YCP ids,
