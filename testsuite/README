ui testsuite

The ui testsuite test the libypc by running all .ui files in
the ui.test directory (ui.test/*.ui) through y2ui.

Every run results in a stdout and stderr output which is
checked agains .out and .err respectively.

The file lib/ui.exp defines a function which runs all tests
contained in ui.test (i.e. makes a 'glob' on ui.test/*.ui)

For every .ui file you put in tests, you must create the proper
.out and .err file with the following command

y2ui < file.ui > file.out 2> file.err
